A general purpose library designed to run on next-generation hardware such as MICs and GPUs


 libparty - Particle Library -
 is an agnostic particle code created by Matt Kinsey and Verinder Rana
 at the 2014 Computational Physics Workshop at Los Alamos National Lab.
 The code is agnostic in the sense that we have capabilities to carry
 out Particle-In-Cell, Molecular Dynamics and abstract particle-particle
 simulations.
 
 In the current version it employs a Nearest Neighbor search and a simple
 Euler advection scheme.
